It's the overall state of your reproductive system at every stage of life, from your first period to the years long after menopause. It includes your hormones, your cycle, your sexual wellbeing, your fertility (whether or not you ever use it), and the long-term health of your uterus, ovaries, breasts, and pelvic floor."),
        t("understanding.0.body.1", "When reproductive health is in a good place, your cycle is reasonably predictable, your periods are manageable, sex is comfortable, you can make informed choices about contraception or pregnancy, and you have access to the information and care you need at every life phase. It also means feeling at home in your body, not bracing against it."),
        t("understanding.0.body.2", "Reproductive health is deeply connected to the rest of you. Stress, sleep, nutrition, movement, mental health, and your social environment all show up in your cycle. A stretch of bad sleep or a stressful month can delay ovulation; chronic under-eating can quiet a cycle entirely. The reproductive system is sensitive precisely because it's protective, it slows down when conditions don't feel safe."),
        t("understanding.0.body.3", "It also changes across your lifespan, and that's normal. Adolescence brings the first decade of cycles finding their rhythm, the twenties and thirties bring questions of contraception and possibly pregnancy, perimenopause reshapes hormones again in the forties, and postmenopause begins a new chapter that lasts decades. Different phases need different attention."),
        t("understanding.0.body.4", "Sexual health is part of reproductive health too, pleasure, comfort, consent, contraception, STI prevention, lubrication, libido, and freedom to ask questions without shame. Painful sex, low desire, or discomfort are not things you have to live with; they almost always have a treatable cause."),
        t("understanding.0.body.5", "Reproductive health lives inside relationships and communities. Being able to talk openly with a partner, friend, or doctor changes outcomes. Silence and shame are some of the biggest reasons reproductive issues go unaddressed for years."),
        t("understanding.0.body.6", "It's something you're allowed to invest in actively. You don't have to wait for symptoms to get serious. A yearly check-in, a simple cycle log, and a clinician you trust can quietly prevent years of confusion later."),
        t("understanding.0.body.7", "And finally, reproductive health is yours. You get to decide what 'healthy' looks like for your life: whether that includes pregnancy or not, contraception or not, hormones or not. Good care should support your choices, not steer them.")
